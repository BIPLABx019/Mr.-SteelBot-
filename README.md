# Mr Steelbot - Transmitter & Receiver Code

This repository contains the Arduino code for the wireless control system of **Mr Steelbot**, a combat-ready robot built for RoboWar, RoboSoccer, and RoboSumo competitions.

The system uses **NRF24L01 2.4GHz RF modules** for wireless communication between the transmitter and receiver. Dual joysticks on the transmitter allow manual control of motor speed and direction, enabling precise movements in battle or on the field.
